IMPORTANT: MISSING MODEL FILE
The pre-trained model weights file (colorization_release_v2.caffemodel) is too large (129MB) to be hosted directly on GitHub.
You MUST download it manually for this application to work.
DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download the file from this direct link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/dx0qvhhp5hbcx7z/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel?dl=1
2. Place the downloaded file into this model/ folder.
Your model/ folder should eventually contain these 3 files:
   * colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt (Already here)
   * pts_in_hull.npy (Already here)
   * colorization_release_v2.caffemodel (You download this)
Reference:
These weights are from the original research by Richard Zhang et al. (ECCV 2016).
